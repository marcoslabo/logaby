# GitHub Account Setup

## Current Situation

You have two GitHub accounts:
- **marcoslabo** - where you created the `logaby` repository
- **marcoslacayobosche** - your currently authenticated Git account

## Options

### Option 1: Use marcoslacayobosche (Simplest)
1. Create a new repository at: https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `logaby`
3. I'll push the code there
4. Deploy to Vercel

### Option 2: Use marcoslabo
1. You need to authenticate with that account
2. We'll push to the existing `marcoslabo/logaby` repo
3. Deploy to Vercel

## Recommendation

**Go with Option 1** (marcoslacayobosche) - it's simpler and you're already authenticated.

Just create a new repo at https://github.com/new with the name `logaby` and let me know when it's ready!
