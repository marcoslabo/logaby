## App Description (4000 chars max)

```
IS SHE EATING ENOUGH?

That question haunts you at 3am.

You're exhausted. Sleep-deprived. Holding a crying baby while trying to remember—was the last feeding 2 hours ago or 3? Did she finish the bottle? When was the last wet diaper?

You try to track it. You really do.

But every baby tracker app wants you to tap through 17 screens while your baby screams. Your hands are full. Your brain is mush. And that "simple" app? It's anything but simple at 3am.

So you give up. You guess. And the anxiety builds.

"Is she gaining weight?"
"Am I feeding her enough?"
"What do I even tell the pediatrician?"

Sound familiar?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

You don't have a tracking problem.
You have a LOGGING problem.

Every baby tracker works great—if you have two free hands, a clear head, and 30 seconds to spare.

But you don't.

You have a baby in one arm, a bottle in the other, and exactly zero patience for tiny buttons and complicated menus.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LOGABY IS DIFFERENT.

Tap the microphone. Speak. Done.

"She ate 4 ounces at 2pm"
"Wet diaper"
"Baby is going down for a nap"
"He weighs 8 pounds 7 ounces"

Our AI understands natural speech. No rigid commands. No learning curve. Just say what happened like you'd tell your partner—and we log it instantly.

One tap. One sentence. Back to your baby.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT LOGABY TRACKS:

◉ Feedings — bottles, breastfeeding, amounts in oz or ml
◉ Diapers — wet, dirty, or mixed
◉ Sleep — naps and nighttime, with duration
◉ Pumping — for breastfeeding moms
◉ Weight — track growth over time

All from your voice. All in seconds.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
