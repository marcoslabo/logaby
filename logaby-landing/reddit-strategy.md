## Content Strategy

### Strategy 1: Value-First Posts (Recommended)

Share genuinely helpful content, mention Logaby naturally.

**Example Post**:
```
Title: [r/NewParents] LPT: Use Siri to track baby stuff hands-free

I was struggling to track feedings/diapers because I never had a free hand to unlock my phone and tap through an app.

Game changer: Set up a Siri Shortcut.

Now I just say "Hey Siri, log 4oz bottle" and it's tracked. No fumbling with my phone while holding a crying baby at 3am.

If you're on iPhone:
1. Download a baby tracking app that supports shortcuts (I use Logaby but there are others)
2. Set up the shortcut once (takes 30 seconds)
3. Just speak to log anything

Works for Android too with Google Assistant.

Seriously, this has saved my sanity. Highly recommend!
```

**Why this works**:
- Provides genuine value
- Not overtly promotional
- Mentions Logaby naturally
- Invites discussion

---

### Strategy 2: Ask for Feedback

Engage the community and get valuable insights.

**Example Post**:
```
Title: [r/beyondthebump] What's your biggest frustration with baby tracking apps?

I'm building a baby tracker and want to make sure it solves real problems.

What drives you crazy about current apps?

For me, it's:
- Having to unlock my phone with a baby in my arms
- Forgetting to log things
- My partner never using it because it's "too complicated"

What about you? What would make you actually USE a baby tracker consistently?
```

**Why this works**:
- Genuine engagement
- Builds community goodwill
- Gets real feedback
- Natural place to mention your solution in comments

---

### Strategy 3: Success Story / Case Study

Share a relatable story (can be your own or a beta tester's).

**Example Post**:
```
Title: [r/Mommit] How I finally got my husband to track baby stuff

My husband never logged anything. Too many steps, he said.

Then I showed him voice logging.

Now he just says "Hey Siri, log wet diaper" and it's done. No unlocking phone, no tapping through menus.

He's been using it for 2 weeks straight. I'm shocked.

If your partner won't use baby tracking apps, try voice commands. It's a game changer.

(I use Logaby but I think other apps support this too?)
```

**Why this works**:
- Relatable problem (partners not logging)
- Genuine success story
- Soft mention of Logaby
- Invites others to share solutions

---

### Strategy 4: "I Made This" Post

Reddit loves when creators share their work (if done right).

**Example Post**:
```
Title: [r/NewParents] I built a baby tracker that works with your voice (because I was tired of fumbling with my phone at 3am)

Hey everyone,

I'm a new parent and I was struggling with baby tracking apps. They all required me to have a free hand, which... I never do.

So I built Logaby - a baby tracker that works with Siri and Google Assistant.

You just say:
- "Hey Siri, tell Logaby 4oz bottle"
- "Hey Google, tell Logaby wet diaper"

And it's logged. No unlocking, no tapping.

It also syncs with your partner in real-time, generates reports for your pediatrician, and tracks pumping sessions.

I'm launching soon and offering 90% off to the first 50 people who join the waitlist.

Would love feedback from this community! What features would you want in a voice-controlled baby tracker?

[Link to waitlist]
```

**Why this works**:
- Transparent about being the creator
- Solves a real problem
- Asks for feedback (not just promotion)
- Offers value (90% off)

**IMPORTANT**: Only post this ONCE per subreddit. Don't spam.

## Sample Reddit Posts (Ready to Use)

### Post 1: r/NewParents

**Title**: How do you track baby stuff when you never have a free hand?

**Body**:
```
Serious question: How do you all track feedings/diapers/sleep when you're constantly holding a baby?

I try to use tracking apps but I always forget because I don't have a free hand to unlock my phone and tap through menus.

By the time I put baby down, I've forgotten what time the feeding was.

Anyone found a solution that actually works?
```

**Follow-up comment** (after discussion):
```
Update: Someone suggested voice commands and it's been a game changer!

I set up a Siri shortcut and now I just say "Hey Siri, log 4oz bottle" and it's tracked. No phone fumbling required.

Using Logaby but I think other apps support this too. Highly recommend!
```

### Post 2: r/beyondthebump

**Title**: LPT: Use voice commands to track baby stuff (no phone fumbling required)

**Body**:
```
If you're like me and never have a free hand to unlock your phone and tap through a baby tracking app, try voice commands.

Set up a Siri Shortcut or Google Assistant routine once, then just speak:

"Hey Siri, log wet diaper"
"Hey Google, log 4oz bottle"

It's been a lifesaver at 3am when I'm half asleep and holding a baby.

Takes 30 seconds to set up, saves you hours of frustration.

(I use Logaby but other apps support this too)
```

---

### Post 3: r/ExclusivelyPumping

**Title**: Hands-free pumping tracking (because who has time to log manually?)

**Body**:
```
Fellow pumpers: Do you track your pumping sessions?

I was terrible at it because I'd be pumping, then forget to log it, then have no idea how much I pumped yesterday.

Started using voice commands and it's so much easier:

"Hey Siri, log pumped 6oz"

Done. Tracked. Timestamped.

Now I can actually see patterns and share data with my lactation consultant.

Anyone else use voice logging? What app do you use?
```
